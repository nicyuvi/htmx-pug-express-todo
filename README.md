# TODO APP / HTMX/PUG/EXPRESS/SQLITE
I wanted to build a web app with minimal dependencies and simplified frontend.
Now all of the logic and state can live in the backend. We can still have
a composable frontend experience using pug as the template engine. 

## Local Development
```
git clone
cd htmx-pug-express-todo
npm run dev
```

This project formats pug files with the vscode recommended extention
